Named Binary Tag (NBT) library for Java based on Graham Edgecombe's JNBT library. NBT is a tag based binary format designed to carry large amounts of binary data with smaller amounts of additional data.

## Getting Started
* [Examples and code snippets](https://github.com/flow/examples/tree/master/nbt)
* [Official documentation](#documentation)
* [IRC support chat](http://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.esper.net/flow)
* [Issues tracker](https://github.com/flow/nbt/issues)

## Source Code
The latest and greatest source can be found here on [GitHub](https://github.com/flow/nbt). If you are using Git, use this command to clone the project:

    git clone git://github.com/flow/nbt.git

Or download the [latest zip archive](https://github.com/flow/nbt/archive/master.zip).

## Test Dependencies
The following dependencies are only needed if you compiling the tests included with this project. Gotta test 'em all!
* [junit:junit](https://oss.sonatype.org/#nexus-search;gav~junit~junit~~~)

## Building from Source
This project can be built with the _latest_ [Java Development Kit](http://oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads) and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) or [Gradle](https://www.gradle.org/). Maven and Gradle are used to simplify dependency management, but using either of them is optional.

For Maven, the command `mvn clean package` will build the project and will put the compiled JAR in `target`, and `mvn clean install` will copy it to your local Maven repository.

For Gradle, the command `gradlew` will build the project and will put the compiled JAR in `~/build/distributions`, and `gradlew install` will copy it to your local Maven repository.

## Usage
If you're using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.html) to manage project dependencies, simply include the following in your `pom.xml` file:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.flowpowered</groupId>
        <artifactId>flow-nbt</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.0</version>
    </dependency>

If you're using [Gradle](https://www.gradle.org/) to manage project dependencies, simply include the following in your `build.gradle` file:

    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        compile 'com.flowpowered:flow-nbt:1.0.0'
    }

If you plan on using snapshots and do not already have the snapshot repo in your repository list, you will need to add this as well:

If you'd prefer to manually import the latest .jar file, you can get it [here](https://github.com/flow/nbt/releases).

## Documentation
Want to get friendly with the project and put it to good use? Check out the latest [Javadocs](https://flowpowered.com/nbt).

To generate Javadocs with Maven, use the `mvn javadoc:javadoc` command. To view the javadocs simply go to `target/site/apidocs/` and open `index.html` in a web browser.

To generate Javadocs with Gradle, use the `gradlew javadoc` command. To view the javadocs simply go to `build/docs/javadoc/` and open `index.html` in a web browser.

## Version Control
We've adopted the [git flow branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) in our projects. The creators of git flow released a [short intro video](http://vimeo.com/16018419) to explain the model.

The `master` branch is production-ready and contains the latest tagged releases. Before a release is made, it is stagged in `release/x` branches before being pushed and tagged in the `master` branch. Small patches from `hotfix/x` branches are also pushed to `master`, and will always have a release version. The `develop` branch is pre-production, and is where we push `feature/x` branches for testing.
